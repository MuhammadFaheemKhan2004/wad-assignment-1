                        all forms of information is required for progress in science, business, and education.
                        The main aim of MS programme in Information Science & Technology (IST) is to
                        design and develop information related applications using information technology by
                        understanding relationship between digital information, people and technology. The MS
                        programme intends to bring together Computer Science and collaborative environment of
                        how people and society interact with digital information MS (Information Science &

                    <p style="font-size: 16px; font-weight:300;">Data Science has become an important due to the
                        need for analyzing and understanding ever increasing data generated by a multitude of
                        sources. By getting admission in the MS programme applicants will not only improve their
                        qualifications but will also be equipped with the latest knowledge in the field. The
                        students will be exposed to different aspects of data science including programming,
                        data structures, and algorithms for data science, data analysis and visualization, and
                        big data analytics. These aspects will provide the students the opportunities to
                        effectively work in local and international markets as well as to pursue a PhD degree in
                        data science.

                        a well-integrated balance of theoretical and practical knowledge required for developing
                        reliable and usable software tools for different fields. The program enables students to
                        design, implement and manage systems combining scientific, computational, communication
                        and multimedia facilities in different domains. The main objective of the program is to
                        provide students with a balanced breadth and depth of knowledge in Computer Science that
                        enables them to begin their professional career in the software industry or they can
                        continue their education at graduate level. In the final three semesters, students
                        enhance their skills and knowledge in one of the following focus areas:
